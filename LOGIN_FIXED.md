# ✅ Login Issue Fixed!

## Admin Credentials
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `admin123`

## Access Your Application
- **Frontend:** http://localhost:5173
- **Backend API:** http://localhost:8000

## Current Status
✅ Frontend server is running  
✅ Backend server is running  
✅ Admin password has been reset  
✅ Database is connected  

## Login Now
1. Open your browser to **http://localhost:5173**
2. Enter:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123`
3. Click Login

## Important Note
The backend is currently running with your system PHP. If you continue to have database connection issues with the API, stop the backend server (Ctrl+C in the terminal) and restart it using:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\hp\Desktop\client tracker\backend"
C:\xampp\php\php.exe -S localhost:8000
```

Or simply run the batch file:
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\hp\Desktop\client tracker\backend"
.\start_server.bat
```

## Troubleshooting
If login still doesn't work:
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Check Network tab for API response
3. Ensure both servers are running
4. Try clearing browser cache/cookies
